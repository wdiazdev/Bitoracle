Description: Bitoracle is a cryptocurrency dashboard that allows users to 
track all their assets on one page and provides market data in real time.
Routing: The web application counts with multiple pages built with react 
router to better allows the user to navigate the content of the web 
application while maintaining the UI in sync with the URL.

Authentication: The authentication process is implemented with Google 
Firebase services and has an easy-to-follow UI and UX. The users can 
create new accounts, sign in, sign out, and recover passwords by email.
Data Fetching: To communicate with the server through the HTTP protocol, 
Axios, the promise-based HTTP client for Node.js, was implemented.

UI Components: The user interface components were built from scratch 
with CSS3 in combination with JavaScript conditional statements to 
dynamically add styles based on market data and user interaction.

Protected route: The dashboard page is protected. Only users who are 
logged in will have access to the Dashboard. On this page, the user will 
be able to create, read, update, and delete their entries following the 
CRUD computer programming model.
