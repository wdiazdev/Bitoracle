BitOracle (a crypto currency dashboard for users to be able to track all their assets on one page and with the ability to provide market data in real time and market-related news).

The routing and the authtentication process is fully completed. I used Google Firebase for the authentication back-end services. Users are now able to create, reset, and log in to their accounts with an easy-to-use process that provides great UX and an eye-catching UI.

Next phase: The next step is to focus on the back-end and logic of the dashboard page to create the experience that I have in mind for users. All the data is coming from the Coin Gecko API.
